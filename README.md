# Express Message.ly

## Description: 

In this exercise from Springboard's Intermediate Express section, I had to write a class object called _User_ and Express routes of a messaging app. The goal was to implement 
JSON web tokens (JOTs) for an extra layer of authentication so only the signed in user can access their messages that they have sent and received. This application has no 
frontend interface, but works within Insomnia requests.
